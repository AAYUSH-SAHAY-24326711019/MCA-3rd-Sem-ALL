/*
 Errors are of two types : logical error and compile time error.
The program will give the undesirable result.

The logical error : true compilation , but the real result and
the unwanted result is acheived.

This is a logical error.
Some errors will be generated at the run tume,
These errors are not due to the fault of the programmer.
A program to run , will need an environment

eg. of the disk file , file handling program.
Then, over the time then by mistake the file deleted or the virus
damaged it or the 3rd person will deleted it.
But onLaunch the data disk file is not found led to errorOnLoad
Now this is a run time error , this occurs in the rare case
known as the exceptional error.

Program at the remote place , network connectivity.
due to the arithemetic exceptions also it may happen.
This is the Arithemetic Exception:
array : arrayindexout of bounds
IO exception : when the undesirable exception will occur , it will
abnormally terminate , then overall progress be lost. 
All resources it will led to be as it is , Leads to the system crash
Program each line must be sensed so that run time due to influence from
the external factors can lead to exceptional error.

The lines which may cause is written in the try block.
A try  then 1 catch.
A try and multiple catch.

Try->catch->Finally is optional , runs any way.
in C# there is the Exception class that is the parent class
and this is the parent of all the exception classes/

Exception from system :System Exception
Exception from Application : Application Exception.
User defined exception : UserDefinedException
