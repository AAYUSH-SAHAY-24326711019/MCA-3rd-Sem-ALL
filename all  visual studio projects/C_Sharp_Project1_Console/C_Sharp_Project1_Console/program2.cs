 There are need of 2 operands then binary operator.

expression produce the resuly , constant , operator , method (combination of any oreder)
and will return us a value after computation.
eg.int result = 10+5; is an expression 

Therea are many expressions.

avoid the name conflict which have the same name , if they are seperate the
